`htmlEscape` returns the given string with the critical reserved HTML codes escaped, such that `&` becomes `&amp;` and so on. It escapes only: `<`, `>`, `&`, `'` and `"`.

Bear in mind that, unless content is passed to `safeHTML`, output strings are escaped usually by the processor anyway.

```
{{ htmlEscape "Hugo & Caddy > Wordpress & Apache" }} â†’ "Hugo &amp; Caddy &gt; Wordpress &amp; Apache"
```

**Front matter** allows you to keep metadata attached to an instance of a [content type][]---i.e., embedded inside a content file---and is one of the many features that gives Hugo its strength.

## Front Matter Formats

Hugo supports three formats for front matter, each with their own identifying tokens.

TOML
: identified by opening and closing `+++`.

YAML
: identified by opening and closing `---` *or* opening `---` and closing `...`

JSON
: a single JSON object surrounded by '`{`' and '`}`', each on their own line.

### TOML Example

```toml
+++
title = "spf13-vim 3.0 release and new website"
description = "spf13-vim is a cross platform distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim."
tags = [ ".vimrc", "plugins", "spf13-vim", "vim" ]
date = "2012-04-06"
categories = [
  "Development",
  "VIM"
]
slug = "spf13-vim-3-0-release-and-new-website"
+++
```

### YAML Example

```yaml
---
title: "spf13-vim 3.0 release and new website"
description: "spf13-vim is a cross platform distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim."
tags: [ ".vimrc", "plugins", "spf13-vim", "vim" ]
lastmod: 2015-12-23
date: "2012-04-06"
categories:
  - "Development"
  - "VIM"
slug: "spf13-vim-3-0-release-and-new-website"
---
```

### JSON Example

```json
{
    "title": "spf13-vim 3.0 release and new website",
    "description": "spf13-vim is a cross platform distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim.",
    "tags": [ ".vimrc", "plugins", "spf13-vim", "vim" ],
    "date": "2012-04-06",
    "categories": [
        "Development",
        "VIM"
    ],
    "slug": "spf13-vim-3-0-release-and-new-website"
}
```

## Front Matter Variables

There are a few predefined variables that Hugo is aware of and utilizes.

### Required

`title`
: The title for the content

`description`
: The description for the content

`date`
: The date the content will be sorted by

`taxonomies`
: These will use the field name of the plural form of the index (see tags and
categories above)

### Optional

`aliases`
: An array of one or more aliases (e.g. old published path of a renamed content) that would be created to redirect to this content. See [Aliases][] for details.

`draft`
: If true, the content will not be rendered unless `hugo` is called with `--buildDrafts`

`expirydate`
: Content already expired will not be rendered unless `hugo` is called with `--buildExpired`

`isCJKLanguage`
: If true, explicitly treat the content as CJKLanguage (`.Summary` and `.WordCount` can work properly in CJKLanguage)

`markup`
: **experimental**; specify `"rst"` for reStructuredText (requires`rst2html`) or `"md"` (default) for Markdown

`publishdate`
: If in the future, content will not be rendered unless `hugo` is called with `--buildFuture`

`slug`
: appears as tail of the url. It can be used to change the part of the url that is based on the filename

`type`
: The type of the content (will be derived from the directory automatically if unset)

`url`
: The full path to the content from the web root. It makes no assumptions about the path of the content file. It also ignores any language prefixes of
the multilingual feature.

`weight`
: Used for sorting

{{% note "Hugo's Default URL Destinations" %}}
If neither `slug` nor `url` is present, and [permalinks are not configured otherwise](/content-management/urls/#permalinks), the filename will be used to create the URL for a page. See [Content Organization](/content-management/organization) and [URL Management](/content-management/urls/).
{{% /note %}}

### User-Defined

You can add fields to your front matter arbitrarily to meet your needs. These user-defined key-values are placed into a single `.Params` variable for use in your templates:

```yaml
include_toc: true
show_comments: false
```

These two user-defined fields can then be accessed via `.Params.include_toc` and `.Params.show_comments`, respectively. The [Variables][variables] section provides more information on using Hugo's page- and site-level variables in your templates.

{{% note %}}
Field names are always normalized to lowercase; e.g., `camelCase: true` is available as `.Params.camelcase`.
{{% /note %}}

## Ordering Through Front Matter

You can assign content-specific `weight` in the front matter of your content. These values are especially useful for [ordering][ordering] in list views. You can use `weight` for ordering of content and the convention of [`<TAXONOMY>_weight`][taxweight] for ordering content within a taxonomy. See [Ordering and Grouping Hugo Lists][] to see how `weight` can be used to organize your content in list views.

## Overriding Global Blackfriday Configuration

It's possible to set some options for Markdown rendering in a content's front matter as an override to the options set in your site `config`.

See [site configuration][config] for more information on Blackfriday configuration options.

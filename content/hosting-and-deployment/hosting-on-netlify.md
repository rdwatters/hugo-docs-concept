## Assumptions

- Have an account with Github, GitLab, or Bitbucket
- Have completed the Quick Start or have a completed website ready for deployment

## Goals

We will connect a git repo to Netlify's continuous deployment service. Pushing a commit to your repo will automatically trigger Netlify's service and deploy your site.

{{% warning %}}
If you installed a theme for your project, be sure to install it as a git submodule. Otherwise, your build will fail. Run the following command in the themes directory of your site folder: `git submodule add https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git`.

## Create a Netlify account

Got to [netlify.com][netlify] and click on the signup button. Alternatively, you may go directly to their [signup page][netlifysignup].

![][1]

Choose how you would like to register your account. You will be able to connect to any service later regardless of what you choose now.

## Continuous Deployment

Click on the service that is hosting your repo.

![][2]

You will see a list of your repos. Click on the repo you wish to connect to Netlify.

![][3]

There are three settings on the Basic Settings tab. If you have multiple branches, you may choose which branch to deploy. Set the publish directory to `public` and the build command to `hugo`. After filling in the fields, click the button that says "Build your site."

![][4]

{{% warning %}}
You may require a different version of Hugo than what Netlify has set as its default. Check Netlify's [documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#common-configuration-directives) on which versions they have available. Specify a particular version for the build command like so: `hugo_0.19`.
{{% /warning %}}

Your site is now configured for continuous deployment, and you may view your site once the build is complete.

## Other Settings

Check out Netlify's settings page and read their documentation for further configuration. You can use custom domain names as well as free HTTPS.

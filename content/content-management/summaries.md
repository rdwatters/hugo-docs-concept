With the use of the `.Summary` [page variable][pagevariables], Hugo can generate summaries of content to show snippets in summary views. The summary view snippets are automatically generated by Hugo and offer two splitting options.

## Summary Splitting Options

You have two options for where the content is split:

* Hugo-defined Summary Split
* User-defined Summary Split

Content summaries may also provide links to the original content. A common design pattern is to see this link in the form of a "Read More..." button. To make this easier, you can leverage the `.RelPermalink`, `.Permalink`, and `.Truncated` [page variables][pagevariables].

### Hugo-defined: Automatic Summary Splitting

By default, Hugo automatically takes the first 70 words of your content as its summary and stores it into the `.Summary` page variable for use in your templates. Taking the Hugo-defined approach to summaries may save time, but it has pros and cons:

* **Pros:** Automatic, no additional work on your part.
* **Cons:** All HTML tags are stripped from the summary, and the first 70 words, whether they belong to a heading or to different paragraphs, are all lumped into one paragraph.

{{% note %}}
The Hugo-defined summaries are set to use word count by default. However, "word count" is relatively defined. If you are creating content in a CJK language and want to use Hugo's automatic summary splitting, set `hasCJKLanguage` to `true` in you [site configuration](/getting-started/configuration/).
{{% /note %}}

### User-defined: Manual Summary Splitting

Alternatively, you may add the <code>&#60;&#33;&#45;&#45;more&#45;&#45;&#62;</code> summary divider where you want to split the article. For [org content][org], use `# more` where you want to split the article. Content that comes before the summary divider will be used as that content's summary and stored in the `.Summary` page variable with all HTML formatting intact.

{{% note "Summary Divider"%}}
The concept of a *summary divider* is not unique to Hugo. It is also called the "more tag" or "excerpt separator" in other literature.
{{% /note %}}

* Pros: Freedom, precision, and improved rendering.  All HTML tags and formatting are preserved.
* Cons: Extra work for content authors, since they need to remember to type <code>&#60;&#33;&#45;&#45;more&#45;&#45;&#62;</code> (or `# more` for [org content][org]) in each content file. This can be automated by adding the summary divider below the front matter of an [archetype](/content-management/archetypes/).

{{% warning "Be Precise with the Summary Divider" %}}
Be careful to enter <code>&#60;&#33;&#45;&#45;more&#45;&#45;&#62;</code> exactly; i.e., all lowercase and with no whitespace. Any mistakes in the divider will tell Hugo to treat the divider as a regular comment and will fail to store your desired content in the `.Summary` variable.
{{% /warning %}}

## Example: First 10 Articles with Summaries

You can show content summaries with the following code. You could use the following snippet, for example, in a [section template][].

{{% code file="page-list-with-summaries.html" %}}
```html
{{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    <article>
      <div class="summary">
        <h2><a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></h2>
        {{ .Summary }}
      </div>
      {{ if .Truncated }}
      <div class="read-more-link">
        <a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">Read Moreâ€¦</a>
      </div>
      {{ end }}
    </article>
{{ end }}
```
{{% /code %}}

Note how the `.Truncated` boolean valuable may be used to hide the "Read More..." link when the content is not truncated; i.e., when the summary contains the entire article.

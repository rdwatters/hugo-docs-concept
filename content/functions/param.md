In Hugo, you can declare [site-wide params][sitevars] (i.e. in your [configuration][]), as well as params for [individual pages][pagevars].

A common use case is to have a general value for the site and a more specific value for some of the pages (e.g., an image).

You can use the `.Param` method to call these values into your template:

```
$.Param "image"
```

[configuration]: /getting-started/configuration/
[pagevars]: /variables/page/
[sitevars]: /variables/site/
